Version 2.0.3 (29 March 2011)
===========================

2011-03-29: wsfulton
            [R] Apply patch #3239076 from Marie White fixing strings for R >= 2.7.0

2011-03-29: wsfulton
            [Tcl] Apply patch #3248280 from Christian Delbaere which adds better error messages when
            the incorrect number or type of arguments are passed to overloaded methods.

2011-03-29: wsfulton
            [Tcl] Apply patch #3224663 from Christian Delbaere.
            1. Fix when function returns a NULL value, a "NULL" command will be created in the Tcl interpreter
            and calling this command will cause a segmentation fault. 

            2. Previous implementation searches for class methods using a linear search causing performance issues
            in wrappers for classes with many member functions. The patch adds a method hash table to classes and
            changes method name lookup to use the hash table instead of doing a linear search.

2011-03-26: wsfulton
	    [C#, Java] SF bug #3195112 - fix wrapping of enums that are type char, for example:
              enum { X = 'X'; }

2011-03-21: vadz
	    Allow setting PCRE_CFLAGS and PCRE_LIBS during configuration to override the values returned by
	    pcre-config, e.g. to allow using a static version of PCRE library.

2011-03-17: wsfulton
	    [UTL] Add missing headers in generated STL wrappers to fix compilation with gcc-4.6.

2011-03-17: wsfulton
	    Fix regression introduced in swig-2.0.2 where filenames with spaces were not found
	    when used with %include and %import. Reported by Shane Liesegang.

2011-03-15: wsfulton
	    [UTL] Fix overloading when using const char[], problem reported by David Maxwell.
            Similarly for char[ANY] and const char[ANY].

2011-03-15: wsfulton
	    [C#] Apply patch #3212624 fixing std::map Keys property.

2011-03-14: olly
	    [PHP] Fix handling of overloaded methods/functions where some
	    return void and others don't - whether this worked or not depended
	    on the order they were encountered in (SF#3208299).
	
2011-03-13: klickverbot
            [D] Extended support for C++ namespaces (nspace feature).

2011-03-12: olly
	    [PHP] Fix sharing of type information between multiple SWIG-wrapped
	    modules (SF#3202463).

2011-03-09: wsfulton
	    [Python] Fix SF #3194294 - corner case bug when 'NULL' is used as the default value
            for a primitive type parameter in a method declaration.

2011-03-07: olly
	    [PHP] Don't use zend_error_noreturn() for cases where the function
	    returns void - now this issue can only matter if you have a function
	    or method which is directed and returns non-void.

2011-03-06: olly
	    [PHP] Add casts to the typemaps for long long and unsigned long
	    long to avoid issues when they are used with shorter types via
	    %apply.

2011-03-02: wsfulton
	    Templated smart pointers overloaded with both const and non const operator-> generated uncompilable
	    code when the pointee was a class with either public member variables or static methods.
	    Regression in 2.0.x reported as working in 1.3.40 by xantares on swig-user mailing list.
